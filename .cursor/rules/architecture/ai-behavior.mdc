# AI-Specific Behavior

- When generating large files, ensure consistency across all sections.
- When editing multiple files, list all files that need changes before modifying them.
- Never hallucinate missing files; ask the user if a file is missing.
- If the user asks for something impossible or contradictory, point it out politely.

## File Creation Rules

- **Do not create intermediate or temporary markdown files** for planning, analysis, brainstorming, or step-by-step breakdowns.
- **Work directly** with the codebase and existing files instead of creating planning documents.
- **Temporary files** may only be created when:
  - Required for a specific technical operation that needs temporary storage
  - The file will be explicitly deleted immediately after use
  - The user explicitly requests a temporary file
- **Changelog exception**: You may create or update a single `CHANGELOG.md` file to track changes. This is the only markdown file you should create for tracking purposes.
- **Always verify and test** changes after applying them, then update the changelog with verification status.
