# Code Quality & Style

- Follow the language’s standard style guide:
    - Python: PEP8 + type hints
    - JavaScript/TypeScript: Prettier + ESLint conventions
    - Go: gofmt + idiomatic Go patterns
    - Rust: rustfmt + clippy-friendly code

- Always include type hints or type annotations when the language supports them.
- Prefer pure functions and stateless design unless state is required.
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies.
- Avoid magic numbers and strings; extract constants when appropriate.
- Write descriptive variable and function names.
