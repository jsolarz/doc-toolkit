# Coding Mode Rules

Optimized for Cursor's AI coding mode, focusing on .NET, Python, and cloud architecture patterns.

---

## Code Generation

- When generating large files, ensure consistency across all sections.
- When editing multiple files, list all files that need changes before modifying them.
- Never hallucinate missing files; ask the user if a file is missing.
- If the user asks for something impossible or contradictory, point it out politely.
- Always include type hints or type annotations when the language supports them.

---

## Multi-File Edits

- Before making multi-file changes:
  1. List all affected files
  2. Explain the change pattern
  3. Verify dependencies between files
- Maintain architectural consistency across related files.
- When refactoring, update all references to renamed components.

---

## Language-Specific Guidelines

### Python
- Follow PEP8 style guide
- Use type hints (PEP 484)
- Prefer pathlib over os.path
- Use f-strings for string formatting
- Follow async/await patterns for I/O operations

### .NET (C#)
- Follow Microsoft C# coding conventions
- Use nullable reference types
- Prefer async/await over Task.Run
- Use dependency injection patterns
- Follow SOLID principles

### TypeScript/JavaScript
- Use TypeScript when possible
- Follow Prettier and ESLint conventions
- Use strict mode
- Prefer const/let over var
- Use async/await over promises

---

## Cloud Architecture Patterns

- Prefer managed services over self-hosted components.
- Design for serverless when appropriate (Lambda, Functions, Cloud Functions).
- Use infrastructure-as-code (Terraform, Bicep, CloudFormation, Pulumi).
- Implement proper error handling and retry logic for cloud services.
- Use environment variables for configuration, never hardcode secrets.

---

## Testing in Code Mode

- Generate unit tests alongside code changes.
- Use appropriate testing frameworks:
  - Python: pytest
  - .NET: xUnit or NUnit
  - TypeScript/JavaScript: Jest or Vitest
- Mock external dependencies (APIs, databases, cloud services).
- Test edge cases and error conditions.

## Code Review Checklist

Before submitting code:
- [ ] All functions have docstrings/XML comments
- [ ] Type hints/annotations are present
- [ ] Error handling is implemented
- [ ] Tests are included or updated
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] Follows project style guide
- [ ] Dependencies are justified and minimal
