# Documentation

- For every new function, include:
    - A clear docstring
    - Parameter descriptions
    - Return value description
    - Error/exception behavior

- When modifying complex logic, add comments explaining the intent.

## Code Comment Standards

**CRITICAL: The following elements are PROHIBITED in code comments unless explicitly approved by the user:**
- **Em dashes (—)**: Never use em dashes. Use commas, periods, or colons instead. Only use if the user explicitly requests or approves.
- **Horizontal lines (`---`)**: Never use horizontal lines for separation. Use whitespace or comments instead. Only use if the user explicitly requests or approves.
- **Emojis**: Never use emojis in code comments. Only use if the user explicitly requests or approves.

**Additional prohibitions:**
- Exclamation marks
- Casual language (TL;DR, FYI, etc.)
- Excessive formatting (bold, italics) when plain text suffices

**Prefer:**
- Clear, concise comments that explain why, not what
- Professional, understated language
- Direct statements without filler phrases
