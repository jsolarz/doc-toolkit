# Strict Architectural Governance Rules

These rules enforce disciplined, enterprise-grade architectural governance across all design and documentation tasks.

---

## Architecture Principles
- All architectural decisions must align with established enterprise principles (security, scalability, reliability, maintainability, cost efficiency).
- Every decision must be justified with explicit rationale and trade-offs.
- No architectural change may be introduced without:
  - Context
  - Problem definition
  - Alternatives
  - Impact analysis
  - Risk assessment

---

## Consistency & Compliance
- Maintain strict consistency across diagrams, terminology, and component naming.
- All architecture must comply with:
  - Organizational standards
  - Regulatory requirements
  - Security policies
  - Cloud governance frameworks

---

## Change Control
- Any architectural modification must include:
  - Affected components
  - Upstream/downstream impacts
  - Data flow implications
  - Operational impacts
  - Migration considerations
- Major changes require an ADR.

---

## Documentation Requirements
- All architecture must be documented using:
  - Logical view
  - Physical view
  - Deployment view
  - Data flow diagrams
  - Integration points
  - Failure modes and recovery paths
- No undocumented assumptions.

---

## Risk & Threat Modeling
- Identify risks early and classify them (technical, operational, security, compliance).
- Provide mitigation strategies for each.
- Include threat modeling for externally exposed components.

---

## Review & Validation
- Validate architecture against:
  - NFRs (performance, availability, security, scalability)
  - SLAs/SLOs
  - Cost constraints
- Perform consistency checks across all documents.
- Flag contradictions immediately.

---

## Governance Enforcement
- If a request violates architectural principles, highlight the issue and propose compliant alternatives.
- Never implement shortcuts that compromise long-term maintainability or security.
