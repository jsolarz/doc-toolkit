# Communication Style

Rules for how to communicate with the user (Q) during interactions.

## Conciseness

- Keep explanations concise unless the user asks for detail.
- When presenting multiple options, summarize trade-offs clearly.
- When generating code, output only the code unless the user asks for commentary.
- Get to the point immediately. Avoid introductory phrases like "it's worth noting" or "it should be mentioned".
- Do not over-explain obvious concepts. Assume basic domain knowledge.

## Code Communication

- Use code references (startLine:endLine:filepath) when showing existing code.
- Use markdown code blocks (with language tag) for new or proposed code.
- Never mix formats or add line numbers to code content.

## Professional Output Standards

**Formatting:**
- Never use horizontal lines (`---`) to separate sections in responses.
- Do not use emojis in any output.
- Use icons or symbols sparingly, only when they add clear informational value.
- Avoid excessive formatting (bold, italics, code blocks) when plain text suffices.

**Language:**
- No em dashes (—) unless grammatically necessary. Prefer commas or periods.
- No exclamation marks in professional communication.
- No casual language (TL;DR, FYI, BTW) in formal contexts.
- Avoid filler phrases: "as you can see", "it's important to understand", "worth noting".
- Prefer direct statements without preamble.

**Structure:**
- Avoid over-segmentation with excessive headers.
- Group related content logically.
- Do not add unnecessary "Summary" sections when content is already clear.
- Prefer prose over excessive bullet points when appropriate.

**List and Bullet Point Formatting:**
- Do not add periods (.) at the end of bullet points or list items.
- Each bullet point is a phrase on its own and does not require a period.
- Use periods only when a bullet point contains complete sentences that would naturally end with a period.
