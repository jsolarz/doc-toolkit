# RFP Compliance Rules
- **Bid Strategy**: Always map responses to specific RFP Section IDs (e.g., "Ref: 4.2.1").
- **Language**: Use persuasive but factual language. Use "Comply" or "Exceeds" where applicable.
- **Evidence**: Always refer to @case-studies.md or @company-profile.md to back up claims.
- **Formatting**: Include an 'Executive Summary' and 'Risk Mitigation' table by default.
