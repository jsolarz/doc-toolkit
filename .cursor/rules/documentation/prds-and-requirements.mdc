# PRD and Requirements Rules

## Requirements Quality

- Capture functional and non-functional requirements separately.
- Requirements must be:
  - Testable
  - Unambiguous
  - Atomic
  - Traceable
- Use "The system shall…" format for formal requirements.
- Provide acceptance criteria using Gherkin or bullet lists.
- Avoid mixing design decisions into requirement documents.

## PRD Structure (Linear-style)

For Product Requirements Documents, use narrative-driven usage scenarios:

- **Usage Scenarios**: Present real-life usage narratives anchored to actual users at actual moments in time
- **Format**: "When [Person] was [doing X] in [Month Year], they [used feature Y] to [achieve Z]..."
- **Purpose**: Help product, sales, and marketing visualize who we're building for
- **Guidelines**: Tell a story, not just list features. Reference real people and real moments (even if anonymized). Show the feature in action within a workflow.

Traditional user stories (As a [role], I want [capability], so that [value]) can still be used in Milestones section for engineering team coordination, but Usage Scenarios should be the primary format for the Usage Scenarios section.
