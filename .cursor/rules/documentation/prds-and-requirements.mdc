# PRD and Requirements Rules

- Capture functional and non-functional requirements separately.
- Requirements must be:
  - Testable
  - Unambiguous
  - Atomic
  - Traceable
- Use “The system shall…” format for formal requirements.
- Include user stories where appropriate:
  - As a [role], I want [capability], so that [value].
- Provide acceptance criteria using Gherkin or bullet lists.
- Avoid mixing design decisions into requirement documents.
