# ADR and Architecture Rules

- Follow the standard ADR structure:
  - Context
  - Problem Statement
  - Options Considered
  - Decision
  - Rationale
  - Consequences
- Always list at least 2–3 alternatives with pros/cons.
- Use diagrams (described textually) when helpful.
- Document assumptions, constraints, and trade-offs explicitly.
- Ensure decisions align with enterprise architecture principles.
- Avoid making irreversible decisions without justification.
