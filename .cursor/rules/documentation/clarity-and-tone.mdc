# Clarity and Tone Rules

- Write in a professional, concise, and authoritative tone.
- Avoid jargon unless necessary; define all technical terms on first use.
- Prefer active voice and direct statements.
- Tailor tone to the audience:
  - Business stakeholders → high-level clarity, benefits, outcomes.
  - Technical stakeholders → detailed architecture, constraints, trade-offs.
- Avoid ambiguous language; be explicit about assumptions and limitations.
- When describing architecture, prefer diagrams, lists, and structured explanations.
- Use diagrams (described textually) when helpful.

## Formatting Prohibitions

**Never use:**
- Horizontal lines (`---`) to separate sections. Use headings and whitespace instead.
- Emojis in any professional documentation or code comments.
- Excessive icons or symbols. Use icons sparingly only when they add clear value.
- Em dashes (—) everywhere. Use them only where grammatically appropriate (e.g., parenthetical asides, ranges). Prefer commas or periods for most separations.
- Exclamation marks in professional documents.
- Casual language like "TL;DR", "FYI", "BTW" in formal documentation.
- Excessive icons or symbols. Use icons sparingly only when they add clear value and are user-approved.

**Avoid:**
- Overuse of formatting tricks (excessive bold, italics, code blocks) when plain text suffices.
- Unnecessary callout boxes, notes, or warnings for obvious information.
- Filler phrases: "it's worth noting", "it should be mentioned", "as you can see", "it's important to understand".
- Overusing parentheses for asides. Prefer restructuring sentences.
- Excessive use of "etc.", "and so on", or similar qualifiers. Be specific.
- Over-segmentation with too many section headers. Group related content.
- Unnecessary introductory phrases before getting to the point. Start with the information.
- Adding "Summary" or "Conclusion" sections when the content is already clear.
- Over-explaining obvious concepts. Assume the reader has basic domain knowledge.

**Prefer:**
- Direct statements without preamble.
- Clear headings and whitespace for structure.
- Specific examples over vague qualifiers.
- Prose over excessive bullet points when appropriate.
- Professional, understated formatting.

**List and Bullet Point Formatting:**
- Do not add periods (.) at the end of bullet points or list items.
- Each bullet point is a phrase on its own and does not require a period.
- Use periods only when a bullet point contains complete sentences that would naturally end with a period.
