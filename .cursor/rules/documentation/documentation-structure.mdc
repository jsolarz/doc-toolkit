# Documentation Structure Rules

- Always structure documents using clear, hierarchical headings (H1–H4).
- Begin every document with an executive summary tailored to the audience.
- Maintain consistent formatting across all documents (headings, lists, tables).
- Use standardized sections for technical documents:
  - Overview
  - Objectives
  - Scope
  - Assumptions
  - Architecture / Design
  - Risks & Mitigations
  - Dependencies
  - Deliverables
  - Acceptance Criteria
  - Appendices
- Use tables for comparisons, compliance matrices, and requirement mappings.
- Ensure every section has complete, meaningful content; avoid placeholders.

## Structural Formatting Rules

**Section Separation:**
- Never use horizontal lines (`---`) to separate sections.
- Use heading hierarchy and whitespace for visual separation.
- Maintain consistent spacing between sections.

**Visual Elements:**
- Do not use emojis in any documentation.
- Use icons or symbols only when they add clear informational value.
- Avoid decorative elements that don't serve a functional purpose.

**Punctuation:**
- Use em dashes (—) only where grammatically appropriate (parenthetical asides, ranges, emphasis).
- Prefer commas, periods, or colons for most separations.
- Avoid overuse of dashes, ellipses, or other punctuation for emphasis.

**Professional Standards:**
- No exclamation marks in professional documentation.
- No casual abbreviations (TL;DR, FYI, BTW) in formal documents.
- Avoid unnecessary emphasis through formatting. Let content speak for itself.
