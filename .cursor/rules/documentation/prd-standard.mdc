# PRD Execution Rules

## Core Structure (Linear-style)

PRDs should follow a 3-section structure that progresses from stable to dynamic:

### 1. Context (Stable - for all audiences)

This section should not change. If it changes, question what we're doing in the first place. This is the fundamental motivation for building the feature.

**Required Elements:**
- **Marketing Statement**: What's the marketing statement for this feature?
- **Why Now**: Why are we building it now?
- **Why We Win**: Why do we deserve to win with this feature?

**Marketing Positioning Framework:**
Even without a dedicated marketing team, the Context section should answer:
- What problem does this solve and for whom?
- What makes our solution uniquely positioned to win?
- What's the compelling reason to build this now vs later?
- How does this differentiate us from alternatives?

### 2. Usage Scenarios (Refined - for product, sales, marketing)

Present real-life usage narratives that we expect to occur as a result of launching this feature. Anchor this to actual users at an actual moment in time that actually happened.

**Format:**
- Tell a story, not just list features
- Reference real people and real moments (even if anonymized)
- Show the feature in action within a workflow
- Example: "When [Person] was [doing X] in [Month Year], they [used feature Y] to [achieve Z]..."

**Guidelines:**
- Should be pretty stable, but refinement happens as we test early builds
- Helps product, sales, and marketing visualize who we're building for
- Be specific enough to guide design decisions

### 3. Milestones (Living - for engineering team)

This section changes a lot in scope and number as we build, design, and discover along the way. This is the "living" part of the PRD.

**Required Elements:**
- Checkpoints, releases, incremental features
- Build order and prioritization
- De-risking strategy (what to de-risk up front, what to leave to the end)

**De-risking Guidance:**
- What needs validation up front?
- What can be deferred?
- What's the minimum viable first release?
- How do we validate assumptions early?

## Audience Segmentation

- **Context**: General audience (everyone needs to know this)
- **Usage Scenarios**: Product, sales, and marketing teams
- **Milestones**: Engineering team working on the feature

## Narrative-Driven Usage Scenarios

Usage scenarios should:
- Tell a story, not just list features
- Reference real people and real moments (even if anonymized)
- Show the feature in action within a workflow
- Help product/sales/marketing visualize who we're building for
- Be specific enough to guide design decisions

**Template:**
- When [Person] was [doing X] in [Month Year]
- They [encountered problem Y]
- They used [feature Z] to [achieve outcome]
- This resulted in [value/benefit]

## Backward Compatibility

For existing PRDs using the traditional 17-section structure, they can remain as-is. New PRDs should use the Linear-style 3-section structure described above.
