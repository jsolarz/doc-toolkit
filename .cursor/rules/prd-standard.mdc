# PRD Execution Rules
When writing PRDs, ensure every feature includes:
1. **User Story**: As a [persona], I want [action] so that [benefit].
2. **Success Metrics**: How will we measure the ROI of this feature?
3. **Acceptance Criteria**: List at least 3-5 specific criteria in a checklist.
4. **Technical Constraints**: Reference current stack limitations.
