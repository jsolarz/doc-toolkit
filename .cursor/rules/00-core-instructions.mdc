# Cursor Rules for Professional Technical Documents
# Applies to: PRD, RFP, Tender Response, Architecture Design, Solution Proposal

# Writing Identity
- Role: Lead Solution Architect & Principal Product Manager.

---

## Validation Rules

Before finalizing any document:
- Check for missing sections.
- Validate requirements for clarity and testability.
- Ensure diagrams (or diagram descriptions) are included.
- Confirm alignment with business objectives.
- Ensure no contradictions exist.

---

## Decision Log Rules

Every document must include:
- Decisions made
- Alternatives considered
- Rationale
- Stakeholders involved

---

## Security & Compliance Rules

When applicable:
- Include data protection requirements.
- Include access control models.
- Include compliance standards (GDPR, ISO, SOC2, etc.).
- Document encryption, logging, and monitoring expectations.

---

## Style Consistency Rules

- Use consistent terminology across the entire document.
- Define all acronyms on first use.
- Avoid filler words and vague language.
- Use present tense for system behavior.

---

## Context Engineering for Document Generation

These principles ensure documents are efficient, structured, and optimized for both human readers and AI processing.

### Context Efficiency

- **Maximize signal-to-noise**: Include only essential, high-value information
- **Eliminate redundancy**: Do not repeat information across sections unless necessary for clarity
- **Use structured formats**: Prefer tables, lists, and structured data over long paragraphs
- **Be concise**: Every word should serve a purpose. Remove unnecessary content.
- **Reference rather than repeat**: Link to other sections or documents instead of duplicating content

### Structured Outputs

- **Use tables for comparisons**: When comparing multiple items, use tables rather than lists
- **Leverage structured formats**: Use JSON schemas, YAML, or structured markdown when appropriate
- **Ensure parseability**: Structure data so it can be easily processed by tools or other systems
- **Define data structures clearly**: When including structured data, provide clear schemas or examples

### Dynamic Context Elements

- **Include temporal context**: When documents reference dates or time-sensitive information, make dates explicit
- **Use placeholders for dynamic content**: When appropriate, use clear placeholders (e.g., `{{ current_date }}`) that can be filled dynamically
- **Document assumptions**: Make implicit context explicit (e.g., "as of [date]" or "based on [version]")

### Document Optimization

- **Prioritize essential sections**: Ensure critical information appears early in the document
- **Use progressive disclosure**: Start with high-level summaries, then provide details
- **Optimize for scanning**: Use clear headings, bullet points, and visual hierarchy
- **Measure effectiveness**: Consider how the document will be used and optimize accordingly

---

## Prohibited Content

- No marketing fluff unless explicitly requested.
- No speculative claims without evidence.
- No ambiguous requirements.
- No mixing business, functional, and technical layers.

## Output Requirements

When generating a document:
- Follow the exact structure defined in these rules.
- Fill all sections unless the user explicitly removes them.
- Use professional formatting.
- Ensure the document is ready for stakeholder review.
- Apply context engineering principles: be concise, structured, and eliminate redundancy.
- Use structured formats (tables, lists) to improve readability and parseability.

## File Management Rules

CRITICAL: Follow these rules for all file operations:

1. Do not generate unnecessary files. Only create files that are explicitly requested or required for the task.
2. Do not delete and recreate whole files. Use search_replace or similar tools to make targeted edits to existing files.
3. Use one CHANGELOG.md file in the root directory. Do not create multiple changelog files or version-specific changelogs.
4. Use one PATCH-*.md file per set of required changes. This file will be deleted after changes are applied. Do not create multiple patch files for the same change set.
5. **MANDATORY**: Always update `SESSION-LEDGER.md` after every user request. This file tracks all conversations, decisions, and context across AI sessions. See `session-ledger.mdc` for detailed requirements.
6. Always update documentation and global files after changes:
   - Update README.md if project structure or usage changes
   - Update docs/design.md if architecture changes
   - Update CHANGELOG.md with all changes
   - Update relevant documentation files
6. Do not use emojis, icons, or horizontal rules (---) in documentation files. Keep formatting clean and professional.
7. Keep documentation clean and concise. Remove unnecessary content, avoid redundancy, and focus on essential information.

## Documentation Location Rules

CRITICAL: Follow these rules for documentation placement:

1. **Global Project Documentation**: Place in `docs/` folder
   - Architecture documents (docs/ARCHITECTURE-*.md)
   - Product requirements (docs/PRD-*.md)
   - Data models (docs/DATA-*.md)
   - Engineering specs (docs/SPEC-*.md)
   - Solution proposals (docs/SOLUTION-*.md)
   - Technical documentation (docs/TECHNICAL-DOCUMENTATION.md)
   - System design (docs/design.md)
   - Code standards (docs/CODE-DOCUMENTATION-STANDARDS.md)
   - Developer guides (docs/DEVELOPER-QUICK-REFERENCE.md)
   - Compliance documents (docs/IDESIGN-CSHARP-CODING-STANDARD-COMPLIANCE.md)

2. **Source Code Specific Documentation**: Place in `src/` folder
   - Application-specific docs: `src/DocToolkit/Docs/` or `src/DocToolkit/README.md`
   - Test-specific docs: `src/tests/DocToolkit.Tests/README.md` or `src/tests/DocToolkit.Tests/Docs/`
   - Component-specific docs: Co-located with source code (e.g., `src/DocToolkit/Engines/README.md`)

3. **Root Level Documentation**: Only essential project files
   - README.md (project overview)
   - SESSION-LEDGER.md (mandatory: tracks all AI interactions and context)
   - CHANGELOG.md (project changelog)
   - ONBOARDING.md (project onboarding)
   - LICENSE (if applicable)

4. **Do NOT create documentation in**:
   - Multiple locations for the same content
   - Temporary or intermediary folders
   - Root directory (except essential files listed above)
