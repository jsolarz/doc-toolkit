1. **Executive Summary**
2. **Purpose & Scope**
3. **Problem Statement / Business Need**
4. **Objectives & Success Criteria**
5. **Stakeholders**
6. **Requirements / Specifications**
7. **Assumptions & Constraints**

## PRD (Product Requirements Document) Rules

### Core Structure (Linear-style)

PRDs should follow a 3-section structure that progresses from stable to dynamic:

1. **Context** (Stable - for all audiences)
   - Marketing statement: What's the marketing statement for this feature?
   - Why now: Why are we building it now?
   - Why we win: Why do we deserve to win with this feature?
   - This section should not change. If it changes, question what we're doing.

2. **Usage Scenarios** (Refined - for product, sales, marketing)
   - Present real-life usage narratives
   - Anchor to actual users at actual moments in time
   - Example format: "When [Person] was [doing X] in [Month Year], they [used feature Y] to [achieve Z]..."
   - Should be pretty stable, but refinement happens as we test early builds

3. **Milestones** (Living - for engineering team)
   - Checkpoints, releases, incremental features
   - Build order and prioritization
   - De-risking strategy (what to de-risk up front, what to leave to the end)
   - This section changes a lot in scope and number as we build, design, and discover

### Audience Segmentation
- **Context**: General audience (everyone needs to know this)
- **Usage Scenarios**: Product, sales, and marketing teams
- **Milestones**: Engineering team working on the feature

### Marketing Positioning (Context Section)
Even without a dedicated marketing team, the Context section should answer:
- What problem does this solve and for whom?
- What makes our solution uniquely positioned to win?
- What's the compelling reason to build this now vs later?
- How does this differentiate us from alternatives?

### Narrative-Driven Usage Scenarios
Usage scenarios should:
- Tell a story, not just list features
- Reference real people and real moments (even if anonymized)
- Show the feature in action within a workflow
- Help product/sales/marketing visualize who we're building for
- Be specific enough to guide design decisions

### Backward Compatibility
For existing PRDs using the traditional 17-section structure, they can remain as-is. New PRDs should use the Linear-style 3-section structure described above.

- Ensure diagrams (or diagram descriptions) are included.
- Confirm alignment with business objectives.
- Ensure no contradictions exist.

---

- Stakeholders involved

---

## Security & Compliance Rules

When applicable:
- Include data protection requirements.
- Include access control models.
- Include compliance standards (GDPR, ISO, SOC2, etc.).
- Document encryption, logging, and monitoring expectations.

---

## Style Consistency Rules

- Define all acronyms on first use.
- Avoid filler words and vague language.
- Use present tense for system behavior.

---

## Context Engineering for Document Generation

These principles ensure documents are efficient, structured, and optimized for both human readers and AI processing.

### Context Efficiency

- **Maximize signal-to-noise**: Include only essential, high-value information
- **Eliminate redundancy**: Do not repeat information across sections unless necessary for clarity
- **Use structured formats**: Prefer tables, lists, and structured data over long paragraphs
- **Be concise**: Every word should serve a purpose. Remove unnecessary content.
- **Reference rather than repeat**: Link to other sections or documents instead of duplicating content

### Structured Outputs

- **Use tables for comparisons**: When comparing multiple items, use tables rather than lists
- **Leverage structured formats**: Use JSON schemas, YAML, or structured markdown when appropriate
- **Ensure parseability**: Structure data so it can be easily processed by tools or other systems
- **Define data structures clearly**: When including structured data, provide clear schemas or examples

### Dynamic Context Elements

- **Include temporal context**: When documents reference dates or time-sensitive information, make dates explicit
- **Use placeholders for dynamic content**: When appropriate, use clear placeholders (e.g., `{{ current_date }}`) that can be filled dynamically
- **Document assumptions**: Make implicit context explicit (e.g., "as of [date]" or "based on [version]")

### Document Optimization

- **Prioritize essential sections**: Ensure critical information appears early in the document
- **Use progressive disclosure**: Start with high-level summaries, then provide details
- **Optimize for scanning**: Use clear headings, bullet points, and visual hierarchy
- **Measure effectiveness**: Consider how the document will be used and optimize accordingly

---

## Prohibited Content

- No marketing fluff unless explicitly requested.
- No speculative claims without evidence.
- No ambiguous requirements.
- No mixing business, functional, and technical layers.

## Output Requirements

When generating a document:
- Follow the exact structure defined in these rules.
- Fill all sections unless the user explicitly removes them.
- Use professional formatting.
- Ensure the document is ready for stakeholder review.
- Apply context engineering principles: be concise, structured, and eliminate redundancy.
- Use structured formats (tables, lists) to improve readability and parseability.

## File Management Rules

CRITICAL: Follow these rules for all file operations:

1. Do not generate unnecessary files. Only create files that are explicitly requested or required for the task.
2. Do not delete and recreate whole files. Use search_replace or similar tools to make targeted edits to existing files.
3. Use one CHANGELOG.md file in the root directory. Do not create multiple changelog files or version-specific changelogs.
4. Use one PATCH-*.md file per set of required changes. This file will be deleted after changes are applied. Do not create multiple patch files for the same change set.
5. **MANDATORY**: Always update `SESSION-LEDGER.md` after every user request. This file tracks all conversations, decisions, and context across AI sessions. See `session-ledger.mdc` for detailed requirements.
6. Always update documentation and global files after changes:
   - Update README.md if project structure or usage changes
   - Update docs/design.md if architecture changes
   - Update CHANGELOG.md with all changes
   - Update relevant documentation files
6. Do not use emojis, icons, or horizontal rules (---) in documentation files. Keep formatting clean and professional.
7. Keep documentation clean and concise. Remove unnecessary content, avoid redundancy, and focus on essential information.

## Documentation Location Rules

CRITICAL: Follow these rules for documentation placement:

1. **Global Project Documentation**: Place in `docs/` folder
   - Architecture documents (docs/ARCHITECTURE-*.md)
   - Product requirements (docs/PRD-*.md)
   - Data models (docs/DATA-*.md)
   - Engineering specs (docs/SPEC-*.md)
   - Solution proposals (docs/SOLUTION-*.md)
   - Technical documentation (docs/TECHNICAL-DOCUMENTATION.md)
   - System design (docs/design.md)
   - Code standards (docs/CODE-DOCUMENTATION-STANDARDS.md)
   - Developer guides (docs/DEVELOPER-QUICK-REFERENCE.md)
   - Compliance documents (docs/IDESIGN-CSHARP-CODING-STANDARD-COMPLIANCE.md)

2. **Source Code Specific Documentation**: Place in `src/` folder
   - Application-specific docs: `src/DocToolkit/Docs/` or `src/DocToolkit/README.md`
   - Test-specific docs: `src/tests/DocToolkit.Tests/README.md` or `src/tests/DocToolkit.Tests/Docs/`
   - Component-specific docs: Co-located with source code (e.g., `src/DocToolkit/Engines/README.md`)

3. **Root Level Documentation**: Only essential project files
   - README.md (project overview)
   - SESSION-LEDGER.md (mandatory: tracks all AI interactions and context)
   - CHANGELOG.md (project changelog)
   - ONBOARDING.md (project onboarding)
   - LICENSE (if applicable)

4. **Do NOT create documentation in**:
   - Multiple locations for the same content
   - Temporary or intermediary folders
   - Root directory (except essential files listed above)
