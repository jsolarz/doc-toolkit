# General Rules for Cursor (Solution Architecture & Technical Writing)

This file defines the universal rules that apply across all tasks.  
All specialized behaviors are delegated to the corresponding `.mdc` files listed below.

## 1. Writing Style (Always Apply)
- Use a technical, professional tone suitable for enterprise engineering.
- Prioritize clarity, precision, and correctness.
- Tailor depth and terminology to the intended audience (executive vs. technical).
- Avoid ambiguity; explicitly state assumptions and constraints.
- When uncertain, ask for clarification before proceeding.
- Never use horizontal lines (`---`) to separate sections. Use headings and whitespace.
- Do not use emojis, excessive icons, or casual language.
- Use em dashes (—) only where grammatically appropriate, not as general separators.

## 2. General Behavior
- Before modifying code or documents, scan relevant files and understand context.
- Prefer minimal, targeted changes unless a broader redesign is explicitly requested.
- Maintain consistency with existing architecture, terminology, and formatting.
- When generating multi‑file changes, list all files affected before editing.
- Summarize progress, blockers, and next steps during handoff.
- **CRITICAL: After every user request, update `SESSION-LEDGER.md` with the interaction details** (see `session-ledger.mdc` for format and requirements).

### File Management Rules
- **Do not create intermediate or temporary markdown files** unless absolutely necessary for a specific task that requires temporary storage.
- **Never create multiple markdown files** for planning, analysis, or intermediate steps. Work directly with the codebase and existing files.
- **Temporary files** may only be created when:
  - Required for a specific operation that needs temporary storage
  - The file will be explicitly deleted immediately after use
  - The user explicitly requests a temporary file
- **Session Ledger file**: **MANDATORY** - Update `SESSION-LEDGER.md` after every user request. This file tracks conversations, decisions, file changes, and context across all AI sessions. See `session-ledger.mdc` for detailed requirements and format.
- **Changelog file**: You may create or update a single `CHANGELOG.md` file to track changes before and after applying them. This file should:
  - Be updated before making changes (planned changes)
  - Be updated after making changes (completed changes)
  - Include verification status for each change
  - List any additional tasks discovered during implementation
- **Always verify changes**: After applying any change, test and verify that:
  - The change was correctly applied
  - The change works as intended
  - No regressions were introduced
  - All related files are updated consistently
- **Task discovery**: When implementing changes, check if additional tasks need to be added to the changelog or todo list based on what you discover during implementation.

## 3. Verification & Accuracy
- Do not invent APIs, features, or capabilities.
- Verify all technical claims against the provided context.
- Flag contradictions, missing information, or unclear requirements.
- When multiple interpretations exist, present them and ask for confirmation.

## 4. Testing & Validation (When Code Is Involved)
- Update or create tests when modifying logic.
- Follow project conventions (.NET → xUnit/NUnit, Python → pytest).
- Cover edge cases, failure modes, and expected behavior.
- Ensure tests are deterministic and isolated.

## 5. Security & Compliance (Always Consider)
- Never log sensitive data.
- Sanitize all user inputs.
- Use secure defaults for authentication, authorization, and data handling.
- Highlight risks, mitigations, and compliance considerations when relevant.

## 6. Reference to Specialized Rule Packs
For domain‑specific guidance, refer to the following `.mdc` files:

### Core Documentation Packs
- `session-ledger.mdc` - **MANDATORY**: Session ledger management and update requirements
- `documentation-structure.mdc`
- `clarity-and-tone.mdc`
- `rfps-and-tenders.mdc`
- `sows-and-contracts.mdc`
- `prds-and-requirements.mdc`
- `adrs-and-architecture.mdc`
- `accuracy-and-verification.mdc`
- `consistency-and-reuse.mdc`
- `communication-and-collaboration.mdc`
- `quality-and-review.mdc`

### Industry‑Specific Packs
- `government-tenders.mdc`
- `defense-industry.mdc`
- `healthcare.mdc`
- `finance.mdc`
- `saas-cloud.mdc`

### Framework‑Specific Packs
- `togaf.mdc`
- `safe.mdc`
- `itil.mdc`
- `iso-standards.mdc`

### Coding‑Mode Pack
- `coding-mode.mdc`  
  (Optimized for Cursor's AI coding mode, .NET, Python, and cloud architecture)

## 7. How to Use This Rule Set
- Apply the general rules in this file to **all tasks**.
- Apply specialized `.mdc` rules **only when relevant** to the task domain.
- When conflicts arise:
  1. **General rules override** specialized rules for tone, clarity, and safety.
  2. **Specialized rules override** general rules for domain‑specific structure or compliance.

## 8. Final Principle
The goal is to produce **high‑quality, accurate, enterprise‑grade technical work** with minimal redundancy.  
This general file defines the core behavior; all other `.mdc` files extend it.
