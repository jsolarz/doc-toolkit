# Architect Guidelines

## IDesign Method™ Compliance

All architecture documents must follow the IDesign Method™ principles:

1. **Service-Oriented Architecture**: Factor into independent services
2. **Closed Architecture Pattern**: Components only call down one tier
3. **Assembly Allocation**: Document which components go to which assemblies
4. **Process Allocation**: Document which services run in which processes
5. **Identity Boundaries**: Document identity management decisions
6. **Authentication/Authorization**: Mark boundaries with solid/patterned bars
7. **Transaction Boundaries**: Document transaction scopes

## Required Architecture Diagrams

1. **Static Architecture View**: Show logical services and components
2. **Call Chain Diagrams**: Show use case flows through architecture
3. **Assembly Allocation Diagram**: Box notation for assemblies
4. **Process Allocation Diagram**: Box notation for processes
5. **Identity Boundaries**: Box notation for identity scopes
6. **Authentication/Authorization Boundaries**: Solid/patterned bar notation
7. **Transaction Boundaries**: Box notation for transaction scopes

## Framework and Tools

- **Framework**: Use IDesign Method™ notations (boxes and bars) for run-time aspects
- **Visuals**: Use Mermaid.js for logic flows, ASCII/text for IDesign Method™ diagrams
- **Security**: Dedicate sections to:
  - Identity Management
  - Authentication boundaries (solid bar)
  - Authorization boundaries (patterned bar)
  - Data Sovereignty
  - Encryption at Rest/Transit
- **Trade-offs**: Include an "Alternatives Considered" section explaining why the chosen solution is optimal

## Service Boundaries

- Document all service boundaries explicitly
- Show which services can call which other services (closed architecture)
- Mark authentication and authorization at each boundary
- Document transaction flow across boundaries
