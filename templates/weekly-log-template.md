# ---------------------------------------------------
## Plan:
This is my daily work ...

This tracks my daily impact across customer projects, presales, and internal enablement.

When I deliver a milestone, unblock a team, or drive a key architectural decision, I write a * line that day.

Whenever an architectural gap, project risk, or scope issue is raised during a meeting and I cannot immediately resolve it, I make a note of it. Some risks are flagged many times before a solution is designed.

Occasionally I review these open action items and mark with a + the risks I have since mitigated or resolved.

## Legend
- `*` = Accomplished / Delivered / Unblocked
- `Note` = Gap identified / Risk spotted / Tech Debt found
- `+` = Fixed a previously noted Gap/Risk
- `!` = CRITICAL Blocker (Needs Escalation)

**Examples:**
- `* **[Presales - Discovery] Client A:** Validated technical fit; they use AWS.`
- `* **[Delivery] Proj X:** Note - Client asked for "Encryption at Rest" but it's not in SOW.`
- `* **[Internal]:** Mentored Junior SA on Kafka sizing.`
