# The Workflow
- Sunday morning: Create one file named 2025-w[WEEK_NUMBER].log.md (e.g., 2025-w18.log.md).
- Daily: Scroll to the bottom and add your * and Notes.
- Thursday afternoon: Scroll up, read your notes, and write the Part 1 summary at the very top.
- Friday: Review and finalize the weekly summary.
- Archive: Move the file to a folder called /2025-Logs.

1.  **[Customer/Project]:** [Action] [Outcome]
2.  **[Customer/Project]:** [Action] [Outcome]
3.  **[Customer/Project]:** [Action] [Outcome]

## 💼 Presales Pipeline (Weekly Movement)
| Customer | Stage | Status | Value | Next Step |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Customer]** | Discovery | 🟢 On Track | $TBD | [Next action] |
| **[Customer]** | Proposal | 🟢 On Track | $TBD | [Next action] |

**Status Legend:**
- 🟢 On Track = Progressing as expected
- 🟡 At Risk = Needs attention, some concerns
- 🔴 Blocked = Critical issues, requires escalation
- ⚪ Not Started = Not yet begun
- 🔵 On Hold = Paused, waiting on dependency

## Delivery Projects (Billable/Active)
| Customer | Project | Status | Health Score | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Customer]** | [Project Name] | 🔴 | 🔴 Red - [Issue description] | [Current status] |
| **[Customer]** | [Project Name] | 🟢 | 🟢 Green - [Status description] | [Current status] |
| **[Customer]** | [Project Name] | 🟡 | 🟡 Yellow - [Issue description] | [Current status] |

**Health Score Guidelines:**
- 🟢 Green = On track, milestones met, no blockers
- 🟡 Yellow = Some concerns, needs attention, timeline at risk
- 🔴 Red = Critical issues, blockers present, escalation needed

# 🔽 PART 2: DAILY LOG (The Raw Feed)
# ---------------------------------------------------
## Plan:
This is my daily work ...

This tracks my daily impact across customer projects, presales, and internal enablement.

When I deliver a milestone, unblock a team, or drive a key architectural decision, I write a * line that day.

Whenever an architectural gap, project risk, or scope issue is raised during a meeting and I cannot immediately resolve it, I make a note of it. Some risks are flagged many times before a solution is designed.

Occasionally I review these open action items and mark with a + the risks I have since mitigated or resolved.

## Legend
- `*` = Accomplished / Delivered / Unblocked
- `Note` = Gap identified / Risk spotted / Tech Debt found
- `+` = Fixed a previously noted Gap/Risk
- `!` = CRITICAL Blocker (Needs Escalation)

**Examples:**
- `* **[Presales - Discovery] Client A:** Validated technical fit; they use AWS.`
- `* **[Delivery] Proj X:** Note - Client asked for "Encryption at Rest" but it's not in SOW.`
- `* **[Internal]:** Mentored Junior SA on Kafka sizing.`

# - Include outcomes: "Received approval" not just "presented"
# - Quantify when possible: "Reduced latency by 40%" not "improved performance"
# - Link to deliverables: Reference documents, diagrams, or code
# - Note blockers immediately: Don't wait to escalate critical issues
# - Use proper markers: * for accomplishments, Note for risks, ! for blockers
