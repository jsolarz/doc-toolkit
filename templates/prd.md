# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## [Feature Name]

---

## Context

**Marketing Statement**: [What's the marketing statement for this feature?]

**Why Now**: [Why are we building it now?]

**Why We Win**: [Why do we deserve to win with this feature?]

> **Note**: This section should not change. If it changes, question what we're doing in the first place. This is the fundamental motivation for building the feature.

**Marketing Positioning Questions to Answer:**
- What problem does this solve and for whom?
- What makes our solution uniquely positioned to win?
- What's the compelling reason to build this now vs later?
- How does this differentiate us from alternatives?

## Usage Scenarios

[Present real-life usage narratives that we expect to occur as a result of launching this feature. Anchor this to actual users at an actual moment in time that actually happened.]

**Example Format**: 
"When [Person] was [doing X] in [Month Year], they [used feature Y] to [achieve Z]..."

**Narrative Template:**
- When [Person] was [doing X] in [Month Year]
- They [encountered problem Y]
- They used [feature Z] to [achieve outcome]
- This resulted in [value/benefit]

> **Note**: Usage scenarios should be pretty stable, but refinement will happen as we start testing early builds. This section helps product, sales, and marketing visualize who we're building for.

## Milestones

[What are the checkpoints, releases, incremental features, that the team should build, and in what order? What do we need to de-risk up front, what do we leave to the end?]

### De-risking Strategy
- [What needs to be validated early?]
- [What can wait until later?]
- [What's the minimum viable first release?]
- [How do we validate assumptions early?]

### Build Order
1. [First milestone - what to build first]
2. [Second milestone - what comes next]
3. [Third milestone - what follows]

> **Note**: Milestones change a lot in scope and number as we build, design, and discover along the way. This is the "living" part of the PRD.
